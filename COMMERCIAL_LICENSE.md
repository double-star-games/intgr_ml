The Software implements proprietary and patent-pending techniques.
This license is intentionally designed to be:

- free and friendly for personal, research, and early startup use
- predictable, transparent, and fair for commercial users

**Fee:**
💵 **$2,500 per year**

**Fee:**
💵 **$25,000 per year**

## 7. OEM / Enterprise / Embedded High-Volume Licensing

We want embedded + edge adoption to be easy, predictable, and fair.
OEM terms apply if **any** of the following are true:

- Annual Revenue > **$50,000,000**, or
- Total Funding ≥ **$50,000,000**, or
- Shipping **100,000+ devices per year**, or

### OEM Base Fee
💵 **$50,000 per year minimum**

This establishes enterprise support, clarity, and commitment.

---

### Per-Device Licensing
Applies only to embedded / device deployments (not normal SaaS/software).

**Indicative pricing ranges**:

| Annual Device Volume | Per-Device Fee |
|----------------------|----------------|
| < 100,000 units      | $0.50 – $2.00  |
| 100,000 – 1,000,000  | $0.10 – $0.50  |
| > 1,000,000 units    | $0.01 – $0.10  |

Pricing is determined based on:
- volume commitments
- product lifetime
- integration depth
- support needs

We do **not** do surprise pricing, predatory licensing, or retroactive fees.
If you succeed, awesome — we just scale together fairly.

---

### Unlimited Deployment Option
If you hate per-device accounting, we get it 😄

We offer an optional **Unlimited OEM License**:

💵 **$250,000 – $500,000 per year**
Unlimited worldwide deployment

If that sounds interesting, email us — we'll make it painless.

---

## 8. Redistribution & Hosting

You **may** distribute the Software only when bundled inside your own product.

You **may not**:

- Distribute the Software as a standalone library
- Host public SDKs, package mirrors, or developer runtimes containing the Software
- Wrap and re-sell it as a machine learning platform

Internal private repos are fine. Public repos are not.

---

## 9. Compliance Philosophy

We keep this simple and professional:

- No intrusive tracking
- No forced reporting for normal users
- Upgrade when you honestly qualify
- If something changes, email us, we'll sort it out reasonably
- Grace periods are normal
- We try to be good humans about this

If someone tries to exploit the license intentionally, then yes — normal legal enforcement applies.
But that's not who we're designing this for.

---

This does not restrict Licensee from defending against patent claims.

## Closing Note

Our philosophy is simple:

> If you scale huge, we succeed with you — without punishment or games.

Thanks for building cool things with **intgr_ml** 💚
